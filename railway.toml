# JoinPounce — Railway Monorepo Configuration
#
# Railway does NOT support a root railway.toml that defines multiple services.
# Instead, each service has its own railway.toml in its subdirectory,
# and is configured in the Railway dashboard with "Root Directory" set accordingly.
#
# Service → Root Directory → railway.toml location:
#   web              → /web     → /web/railway.toml
#   api              → /api     → /api/railway.toml
#   price-checker    → /worker  → /worker/railway.toml (startCommand: node dist/price-check.js)
#   notify-dispatcher → /worker → /worker/railway.toml (startCommand: node dist/notify.js)
#   dead-link-checker → /worker → /worker/railway.toml (startCommand: node dist/dead-links.js)
#
# Cron schedules (set in Railway dashboard per service):
#   price-checker:     0 9 * * *   UTC
#   notify-dispatcher: 30 9 * * *  UTC
#   dead-link-checker: 0 3 * * *   UTC
#
# See README.md → Deployment section for setup instructions.
