# railway.toml — placed in /worker
# Root Directory for this service: /worker
# Railway will use this file when deploying cron worker services.
# Each cron service (price-checker, notify-dispatcher, dead-link-checker)
# uses the same /worker source but different startCommands configured
# in the Railway dashboard per service.

[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"

[deploy]
# startCommand is overridden per-service in the Railway dashboard:
#   price-checker:    node dist/price-check.js
#   notify-dispatcher: node dist/notify.js
#   dead-link-checker: node dist/dead-links.js
startCommand = "node dist/price-check.js"
